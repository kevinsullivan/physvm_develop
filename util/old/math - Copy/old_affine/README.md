## main abstractions
- real_affine_space : specializes affine coordinate space
- aff_coord_space   : affine coordinate spaces

## dependencies for the main abstractions
- affine           : defines notation for an affine space
- g_space          : types in which group acts on set leading to torsors
- add_group_action : additive group stuff
- list_stuff       : utility functions on lists to support vector abstractions
